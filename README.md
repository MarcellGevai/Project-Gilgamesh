## Introduction
Project Gilgamesh is inspired by the Epic of Gilgamesh. Our project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to identify early patterns in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and mental health conditions like depression and sleep disorders. The goal is to facilitate real-time predictions, enable early diagnoses, and provide actionable insights to improve patient outcomes while reducing healthcare costs.

## Features
- Real-time disease risk prediction for multiple conditions.
- Analysis of shared patterns across diseases using machine learning.
- Actionable insights for early diagnosis and clinical trial recruitment.
- Scalable approach, applicable to other disease groups in the future.
